        <h1>our mission</h1>
        <p>
          Our mission is to raise awareness and address global issues through
          fashion and action. At a better tomorrow, we value transparency, action,
          and the idea that every act of good helps, no matter how small. We address
          prevalent social issues by relating a charity/organization/unified effort
          to each release of clothes and donate 51% of profits to the organization.
          For our current release, we will donate to the Miami Rescue Mission in
          Miami, FL. First, the money donated would allow the organization to
          continue to fund and expand their operations to help out their community
          in South Bend. Also, this will raise awareness so we can lead a more
          unified effort to help. Finally, we aim to turn the nation away from fast
          fashion and would like to promote more sustainable clothing options.
